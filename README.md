# SNPer

A small tool that will help you visualize the GWAS results from many different experiments. 

The accepted dataformat is ".csv" files. 

In the first tab - select your file and select all the neccessary column identifiers from the drop-down menus. Once you are finished, click on "Set the dataset" button. 

The new dataset can be viewed in the sub-tab "Selected data"
